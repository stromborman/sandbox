Solution to Advent of Code 2020: Day 25
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/25

This problem is an instance of Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange.

Alice and Bob publiclly agree on prime p and number g (with order p-1 in Z_p*)
(in this problem p = 20201227 and g = 7)

Alice and Bob secretely each pick private A and B and
publically transmit a = g^A mod p and b = g^B mod p
(in this problem a and b are the inputs)

Alice and Bob then compute: F = b^A = a^B mod p (since g^AB = g^BA)
(in this problem F is the answer)

A brief google search suggests there is no known clever way to recover F
from the public information of p, g, a, b.  The solution below
just tries each n until it finds g^n = a.
