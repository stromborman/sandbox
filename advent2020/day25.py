This problem is an instance of Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange.

Alice and Bob publiclly agree on prime p and number g (with order p-1 in (Z/p)^*)
(in this problem p = 20201227 and g = 7)

Alice and Bob secretely each pick private A and B and
publically transmit a = g^A mod p and b = g^B mod p
(in this problem a and b are the inputs)

Alice and Bob then compute: F = b^A = a^B mod p (since g^AB = g^BA)
(in this problem F is the answer)

Below we implement the baby-step giant-step algorithm for solving
the discrete logorithm problem: given g^A mod p, recover A

With the private A we compute F = b^A mod p
